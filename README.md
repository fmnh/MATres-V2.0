# MATres (Version 2.0)

MATres is a free, open-source software package designed to facilitate accurate targeting of brain areas for stimulation and/or electrophysiological recording in therapeutic applications and basic neuroscience research. It provides an end-to-end solution that accommodates all steps required for exact localization, visualization, and targeting regions of interest (ROIs) using standard atlases and skull implants, including various preprocessing, registration and warping procedures, and 3D reconstructions.

## Features

* Improved ROI visualization and selection tools
* Enhanced compatibility with different imaging modalities and atlases
* More efficient and accurate registration and warping procedures
* Improved 3D reconstruction and visualization capabilities
