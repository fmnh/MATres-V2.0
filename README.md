# MATres V2.0

MATres is a comprehensive, open-source software package designed to enable precise targeting of brain areas for stimulation and/or electrophysiological recording in therapeutic applications and fundamental neuroscience research. The software offers an all-inclusive solution for accurately localizing, visualizing, and targeting regions of interest (ROIs) utilizing standard atlases and skull implants. Version 2.0 supports various preprocessing, registration, warping procedures, and 3D reconstructions for macaque and human T1 MRI images, as well as marmoset T2 MRI images.

## Features

* In version 2.0, MATres introduces registration and warping capabilities for marmoset T2 MRI images. The software now includes marmoset T2 MRI atlases, accessible from the [Marmoset MRI-NA216 website](https://dataportal.brainminds.jp/marmoset-mri-na216) for T2 MRI images.
* Refined ROI visualization and selection tools
* Expanded compatibility with various imaging modalities and atlases
* Streamlined and accurate registration and warping processes

## Usage

MATres V2.0 is suitable for numerous applications, such as:

* Precise targeting of brain areas for stimulation and/or electrophysiological recording in therapeutic applications and fundamental neuroscience research
* Accurate localization, visualization, and targeting of regions of interest (ROIs) using standard atlases and skull implants
* A range of preprocessing, registration, warping procedures, and 3D reconstructions
